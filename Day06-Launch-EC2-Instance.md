# ☁️ Day 06 – Launch EC2 Instance

## 📌 Challenge Description

The objective of this task was to launch an Amazon EC2 instance with the required configuration to support application deployment in the cloud environment.

Launching EC2 instances is a fundamental cloud operation and forms the base of most cloud architectures.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Launch a new EC2 instance.
- Select the appropriate Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
- Choose instance type based on requirements.
- Configure networking and security.
- Verify instance status.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

### ✅ What is an EC2 Instance?

An EC2 instance is a virtual server in AWS used to run applications, services, and workloads.

It provides:
- Compute capacity
- Scalable resources
- Flexible configurations
- On-demand provisioning

---

### ✅ Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

An AMI defines:
- Operating system
- Pre-installed software
- Boot configuration

Common AMIs include Linux, Windows, and custom images.

---

### ✅ Instance Types

Instance types define:
- CPU capacity
- Memory size
- Network performance
- Cost

Choosing the right type balances performance and budget.

---

### ✅ Networking and Security

Instances are launched inside:
- A VPC
- A subnet
- Associated with security groups

Security groups control inbound and outbound traffic.

---

### ✅ Key Pair Authentication

Key pairs are used for secure SSH access instead of passwords.

Private keys must be protected.

---

### ✅ Instance Lifecycle

Instance states include:
- Pending
- Running
- Stopped
- Terminated

Understanding lifecycle helps in automation and cost control.

---

## ❌ Issues and Learning

- Verified subnet and security group selection carefully.
- Ensured key pair selection matched configuration.
- Confirmed instance reached running state.

---

## ✅ How the Task Was Completed

- Logged into AWS Console.
- Navigated to EC2 service.
- Launched a new instance.
- Selected required AMI and instance type.
- Configured network and security group.
- Attached key pair for access.
- Launched and verified instance status.
